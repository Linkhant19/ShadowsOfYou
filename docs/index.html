            <p> When time presents itself as an enigma, I find myself stuck at the crossroads through and through,
                <br>
                And, when the light shines on my hidden past, I see...</p>

            <p> On an ordinary day, on an ordinary night, you are walking through the same-old streets or lying in your same old bed. Suddenly, you hear a piercing scream and they have appeared again. <b><em>Shadows</em></b>. You see them on the strangers in the street. The white walls that you used to scribble your dreams on are now covered in horrid silhouettes. Peter lost his <b><em>shadow</em></b> to fly away, but now you are falling again. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You wonder. If they left, then why do you still see <b><em>shadows</em></b> of them at 1 am on the walls in your dimly lit bedroom? You see <b><em>shadows</em></b> under the spotlights of your past, your present, and your future, and you begin to fear if this is a selfish decision to let these people who care about you into your life. All you are is heavy-weight carrying every <b><em>shadow</em></b> of your past, and even though you try so hard to be as light as bright sunshine for those you love, sooner or later, they will get introduced to the tears that come out at 2 am. Before you can change, they have also become part of the <b><em>shadows</em></b> on the white walls. They have walked out of your door.
